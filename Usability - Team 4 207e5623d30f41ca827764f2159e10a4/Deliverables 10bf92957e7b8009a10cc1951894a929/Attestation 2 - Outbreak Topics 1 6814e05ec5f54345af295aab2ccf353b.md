Instructions:

Look for two existing solutions that are similar to your product for this topic and analyze them based on the theory. This means that it is best not to always use the same 2 products, but rather those that fit best with this USAB topic. If you are creating an app for a flower delivery service, the apps you analyze do not have to come from the flower delivery sector.

Remark: We should tell them which 4 topics they should look at in depth for grading. They will look at the other topics more as a test.

Summarize the findings/learnings in a table. Explain your findings from the perspective of the persona.

Important: keep your personal opinion to yourself. Remain objective and do not draw conclusions from yourself to others. We expect at least 5 results per product tested. A maximum of these may be positive per product tested.

Also mention what is well solved and why.
