Annabella, a student balancing her studies and a part-time job, gets home late and needs to
cook a quick meal with what she has at home. She opens the “MealBestie” App and presses
on the menu bar the home page icon to find a recipe. She seems something she likes and
clicks on it to start preparing, after she is done cooking and eating, she thinks of how much
she liked the recipe so she opens the app again to “star” the recipe so she can make it again
in the future. Thanks to the consistency of the app with the conventions in other cooking
apps, Annabella doesn’t need to have a cognitive load to use the app and spend extra time
learning what everything means.
