Consider and point out where in your product:

## Errors can occur

Users may be presented with recipes that don't match their dietary restrictions, preferences, or current dietary goals. For example when Annabella sees a lot of recipes with milk in it, but she is lactose intolerant.

Users may receive more notifications than they want, causing unnecessary interruptions. Overwhelming or irrelevant notifications can annoy users or even cause them to turn off notifications altogether.

Typos or minor misspellings can lead to empty search results or incorrect recipe suggestions, making it difficult for users to find what they're looking for.

If the user has trouble finding key features or frequently clicks the wrong way because of unclear icons or labels, it could lead to a poor user experience.

## Special trust, security, data protection is necessary

The app should protect personal information, such as dietary preferences and food allergies, which are sensitive. Users need to feel confident that their information will be stored securely and not shared without their permission.

Users should have control over the type and frequency of notifications they receive. This helps prevent trust erosion by making users feel that their time or attention is not being respected.

Users need to understand why certain recipes are recommended. Transparent labeling helps users trust that the app is showing relevant suggestions tailored to their preferences.

## What could prevent use?

If the app doesn't seem to learn from the user's interactions or adapt to their changing preferences, users may feel the app isn't "for them" and lose interest.

An overly complex or confusing layout can discourage use, especially for users who prefer intuitive navigation without a learning curve.

Irrelevant or untimely reminders can be particularly demotivating when the user is going through a temporary change (e.g., after surgery) or when the application prompts with outdated or insensitive suggestions.

## In which step does the user feel like? Are there situations that could be unfavorable?

Typing errors or restrictive search filters can be frustrating when users can't find recipes that meet their current needs.

If it's difficult to adjust dietary or notification preferences, users may feel that the app doesn't respect their individual needs.

Users may feel frustrated if there isn't a clear way to provide feedback or correct an error in the recipe suggestions. They may feel that their input doesn't affect the functionality of the application.

## Can something be annoying depending on the situation?

A user's personal situation may affect their perception of the application's features. For example, a user who has gone through surgery can't follow his or her usual diet.

If notifications are too frequent or not aligned with the user's interests, they can quickly become annoying and disruptive to the user experience.

Static suggestions that don't adapt to seasonal or personal dietary changes can annoy users who want dynamic, relevant content.

## Is the user always in control?

If users can't control their notification preferences, they may feel the app is too intrusive.

Users need an easy way to adjust or refine recommendations, especially as their preferences evolve.

Flexible filtering options ensure that users feel they can tailor recipe results to their exact needs. Without this, users may feel that the application doesn't respond to their specific needs.

## Can a change in the personal situation lead to a new perception of features?

From Prof: Example fitness app: After surgery, the user runs more slowly and the app always reminds
him/her of this. -> Unnecessary, annoying!

Medical conditions, dietary changes, or lifestyle changes can affect how users perceive features. For example, if a user is temporarily avoiding certain foods, they may find it irritating if the app continues to push those recipes.

## What measures can you take to ensure that the user continues to use your app?

Recommendations should evolve with user interactions to better match their preferences. Showing why a recipe was recommended can increase trust and engagement.

Allowing users to customize notifications (both frequency and type) ensures they receive only relevant, non-intrusive alerts.

Keeping the interface simple and intuitive encourages regular use. Familiar design elements, such as common icons and layouts, help users feel at ease right from the start.

Easy-to-use and forgiving filtering/search options make it easy for users to find what they need, even with minor errors or typos.

Regularly updating the content with seasonal and trending recipes keeps the app dynamic and exciting.
