## What was difficult?

Nothing

Having a blind person demonstrate the technology available for them, such as the screen reader.

There was none.

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

Communicate with the disabled people you‚Äôre trying to take into accound and ask for their opinions. Or put yourself in their shoes, like blindfolding yourself to check screen readability rather than checking it as a sighted person.

## Open questions we would like to ask?

None
