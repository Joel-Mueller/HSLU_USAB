## What have we learned?

- *ask disabled people for their input*
- *links are a different colour and underline*
- There are 5 types of handicaps:
    - Visual
        - a continuum/spectrum
        - slight to full blindness
        - colour blindness / struggle with contrast discerning issues
        - solutions:
            - using a screen reader to filter
                - typical problems: [copy from slide 9]
            - high zoom factor
    - auditory
        - continuum / spectrum
        - closed captions on videos and podcasts
            - if a person is deaf from birth written language is a foreign language → written language on a website cannot be too complex (especially for no reason)
    - motor
        - affects different bodies
        - inhibits use of mouse / touchpad → keyboard navigation
        - typical problems
            - site inaccessibility through keyboard
            - UI-components too small → require fine motor function
    - cognitive/neurologic
        - epilepsy, learning difficulties, attention disorders, dementia
        - typical problems
            - unpausable videos
            - missing labels & alt text / language too complex

- legal situation in ch:
    - legal constitution in CH
    - BehiG act
    - cantons…
- legal situations in europe
    - slide 17
- slide 19
    - …
    - we all benefit from accessible access
- websites to check this:
    - slides 25 & 26
- colour contrast shit
- colour contrast checking website:
    - slide 32
- information contrast
    - slide 35 → differentiating just by colour is more difficult to distinguish than differentiating by both colour and shape
