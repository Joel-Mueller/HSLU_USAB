## Artefacts that we have created and delivered

We made a presentation about a topic in Empathy and made a presentation about it. Each team got a half an hour time to prepare. The ressources where given and we had to extract a quick presentation and a question for the class out of it. We applied these learnings from the presentation in the following questions and also for the analysiys of two example products and of course to our own project.

## What have we learned?

### Empathy vs Sympathy

- If you want to help someone, you need to empathise with people instead of sympathise
- You have to try to put your self in someone else's shoes, also when you haven’t experienced what they are experiencing
- You have to imagine how it feels like (emotionally and practically) to be in this persons situation

### How we create Empathy

For Empathy, you have to know a person and their situation really well for doing that we can:

- Ask questions and really try to understand what the challenge is
- Don’t say “i’ve been there also before” and talk about that. This takes the attention to you
- The person you are trying to understand should be in the fokus and therefore should als talk

### Design

- A Person who user a product the first time will need more time to use it than a experienced one
- Some websites have two buttons, one you can click and the other one you can’t. This is a bad example and you should not implement this. A person should know if it a object is a button and also what the button is supposed to do
- Big dropdown are not good for empathy. They are not intuitive and are tedious to use. Therefore you should avoid it. For example with:
    - Input fields with auto completion
    - Region based input where it already tries to know or guess where you are at (based on ip address)
    - Show the most popular selections at first
- A good trick to see if a site has a intuitive design is squint eyes together and you should see the most important thing on the website
- Work with icons (picture says more than 1000 words)

### Familiarity

- Something is intuitive for a user if he is already familiar with a design
- Example Apple
    - iPhone looks every year the same. People how have a iPhone are familiar with it and are more likely to buy another one when the phone they have right now breaks down
    - The Icons are looking more or less the same on Mac, iPhone and on the Apple Watch. People who have an iPhone will be faster familiar also with a Mac
- Example McDonalds
    - If i am on Vacation, and the food is different than at home, I know what i am getting when i walk into the McDonalds and order a Big Mac. This gives me familiarity in a maybe not so familiar country
- Example Airbnb
    - Airbnb used to look like a conventional hotel booking site, but now it changed to a whole new design to look fresh and new
    - Old hotel booking designs are boring and old and Airbnb didnt wanted to be associaated with that.
- A user spent most of their times somewhere else than on your site, so you have to be similar to others.
- You can make small features that are nicer and new, but integrate it in a familiar design and don't change everything at once

## What was difficult?

In examples, it seems easy to react or handle with empathy. But when we got practical examples and it wasn’t so easy anymore. It was really hard to find the right questions to ask that we can understand the user as good as possible. 

## What was the highlight?

To learn how important familiarity is for a product. When we use a product, it has to be fast and intuitive. But we often forget as a designer for a great product that not just we, the designers, use the app. The app is used by a target group which is maybe different than ourselves. Eventually, the app goes also beyond the target group. 

## What was the lowlight?

There wehre a lot of topics and a lot of groups. It sometimes felt that we went through every topic within empathy, but went nowhere realy in the detail.

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

> Steve Jobs: “**Start with the Customer Experience, then work back to the technology**”
> 

Sometimes in the digital world, we have a technology that we want to use or we want to step into a market and work from there on. This is not what we should do. We should find the user in the real life and find out what the user wants and than have to work back to the technology.
