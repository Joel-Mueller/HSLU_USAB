# Learn Facts

## Artefacts that we have created and delivered

This week’s lecture was more focused on the theory: we watched a few videos about errors and error-handling, then conversed about the topic while always interacting with the teacher, answering questions and expressing our thoughts. As such, no written exercises or physical artefacts where produced.

## What have we learned?

We learned that errors in user interactions often stem from actions not performing as expected due to mismatched mental models between designers and users. Designers build interfaces based on their assumptions about how users think, which can differ from the user's actual understanding. 

Errors fall into two main types: *slips*, which are unconscious mistakes due to inattention, and *mistakes*, which occur when the user consciously misinterprets information or when mental models misalign. To prevent slips, designers should guide users through processes clearly. Avoiding mistakes, on the other hand, requires understanding the user’s mental model. 

Some notable error prevention strategies include using redundant elements, like loading animations or save buttons, even when unnecessary, to reassure users. For critical actions, such as deleting important data or on critical systems such as state-wide alarm systems, additional confirmation steps *might* help prevent irreversible actions.

## What was difficult?

We think that this week’s topic was quite easy to comprehend; we have all already made mistakes and/or slips after all, therefore we can’t say that a part of this lecture was tougher than any other.

## What was the highlight?

The highlight was definitly viewing the video of the news broadcast about that false hawaiian doomsday alarm triggering, the consequences of what poor slip-prevention mechanisms could be were well demonstrated.

## What was the lowlight?

It was all pretty interesting!

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

“*Design is not just what it looks and feels like. Design is how it works*” as Steve Jobs famously put it.

This insight emphasizes that truly effective design goes beyond aesthetics to align with users' expectations and mental models, creating seamless, intuitive experiences. Aim for designs that anticipate potential user errors and provide subtle guidance, ensuring every interaction feels natural and leads smoothly to success.

## Open questions we would like to ask?
