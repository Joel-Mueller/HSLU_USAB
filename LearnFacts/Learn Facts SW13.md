## Artifacts that we have created and delivered

## What have we learned?

For what is Usability testing good?
- Maybe the producer thinks it is common sense but for the end user it is not so clear
- When you want to see if a idea is actually good, you dont need a usable product you just need to see if its good

- You should not test it because you are to close to the product
- Ask user to speak out loud
- Pick random peple (Better stranger because they are more honest than friends)
- Take notes what peple say
- After five people it is mostly repetition
- Do it again

## What was difficult?

Understanding that there are a lot of stages for testng, for example:
1. Designablity (Some people have the wrong product right because nowbody buys it) -> wen want to understand the user need, we call this also pretotyping
2. Test how it works, now it is prototyping, should be 10 Franks and the last one 100 Franks
3. Test how it feels, for example visual design should be 1000 Franks

## What was the highlight?

Realizing that we have to do usability testing earlier than we thought, for example
- Not the whole product and every case has to be thought out, only one scenario has to be ready
- If you want to see if something works dont just figma right away, test it first with other things because the UI is just distracting when you are still figuring out how the product should work.
- You can test with paper a lot before using figma and other design tools

## What was the lowlight?

Nothing

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

When I would meet a student, who wants to do usabiltiy testing, I would give him following walkthrough
- Have a scenario first
- You need a test person
- You need a guide to talk to the person
- You need someone to take notes or a camera
- Maybe you need someone who changes the states
- You need a person which changes the stages
- A user shoudl talk a lot, if the person doen't talk a lot, you need to ask qeustion
- As a guide just say the state but not press here or somkething else what do do
