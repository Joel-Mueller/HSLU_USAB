## Artefacts that we have created and delivered

We had to fill in a table on Miro where we had to discuss a question ‚ÄûWhat are the different levels of feedback and how would we apply them to our app?‚Äú

We also had to write down how we would implement accelerators (shortcuts) for more advanced users of our app.

## What have we learned?

We learned that flexibility is key for users to choose how they want to get to their goal. 

Accelerators are also important for specific user (more advanced or that use the app/website for a specific reason (work related) and is more efficient. We also learned that feedback is crucial and it happens in different levels across the system as a whole. It also has different types based on the time spans and causality of it. Some feedback should be more urgent than others and depending on the urgency then it should have an equally urgent response.

## What was difficult?

It was difficult to visualize how to implement it while we are in such an early stage of our product but we could still visualize through examples of other companies and solutions.

## What was the highlight?

The highlight was seeing everyone present their questions because it forced students to simplify the topic as much as possible while still getting the idea through to others easily and with examples.

## What was the lowlight?

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

Users want to make their own decisions, they don‚Äòt want to follow the single path drawn out for them, some will have their own way of doing things but want to reach their goal anyway. To be on your users good side always keep this in mind to give them the flexibility of how they want to reach their goal within your system. Also note that efficiency is not always the answer, making a process more efficient doesn‚Äòt work everyone in the same way, and if your efficiency solution does not work you can lose the users‚Äò trust in an instant, this is very hard to gain back. So even if you make something more efficient give your users the possibility to choose if they want to implement it or not.
