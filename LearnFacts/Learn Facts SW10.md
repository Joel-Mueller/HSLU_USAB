## Artifacts that we have created and delivered

The main outlook of the exercises we solved was the consistency framework (Exercise 4)

We had to write in a table the consistency type and our thoughts on it. 


| | **Consistency Type** | **Thoughts** |
|-|-|-|
| 1. |	Induced Inconsistency (External consistency) |	It is important to be visually inconsistent, so the user knows when something acts different than another thing. ‚ÄúMake objects that act differently look different‚Äù. We need to consider which external consistencies are present and which need to be taken into account. |
| 2. |	Consistency with User-Expectations	| Knowledge about the users and their experiences/expectations is crucial. We must derive the UI from the context (cooking, finance, games) and the expectations of the user. |
| 3. |	Continuity | We need to strive for continuity over time. If an app is released as a new version of the last, it should follow some consistencies from the older one that can guide the user while still having a level of innovation in comparison. |
| 4. |	Induced Inconsistency (Internal consistency) |	What can we use to draw the attention of the users and communicate with them how the app works (colors, icons, etc)? |
| 5. |	Functional Consistency Navigation (Internal consistency) | Where do we place what and how do we do things in our app? We can ensure consistency in how we place form fields and buttons, how our homepage looks and so on. |
| 6. | Visual consistency, layout, muster Schrift, Icons (Internal consistency) |	The symbols, icons, and images we used should be consistent across the app. This includes things like the border color and weight of the images on our site, the color scheme we use, the icons we use on each page. |
| 7. |	Content Text & Tonality (Internal consistency) |	Depending on the message you want to share or how you want your app to look to users you need to set the tone and stick to it (comedic, smart, witty, friendly, etc.) |


## What have we learned?

- In usability, the contents should be consistent.
- There are two types of consistency in UX: Internal consistency and external consistency. We should strive to maintain both kinds of consistency because every change we make equates to a cognitive load on the user (a cognitive load means the user needs to learn something new)
- The internal consistency is how we implement specific characteristics inside our own app design and the represent something (a bright color for buttons that can be clicked on and a light color for static buttons) while external consistency is how we align with the industry (heart for liking something, a spoon icon for cooking, etc.)
- There are different levels of internal consistency: Visual consistency, functional consistency and content consistency.

## What was difficult?

Understanding the consistency framework was harder than the other exercise because it wasn‚Äôt very clear what kind of thoughts we had to describe (in our app, about the importance of each, what each element means) and the ‚Äúconsistency types‚Äù there are only two types and the rest fall into the levels of consistency, this made it hard to understand what one had to do with it and how we could use it.

## What was the highlight?

The examples for consistencies and inconsistencies.

## What was the lowlight?

It would‚Äôve been better to go through the slides in class (with the teacher) so we could hear the answers to the exercises.

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

‚ÄúWe should meet the expectations of the user, users should not have to wonder whether words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.‚Äù
