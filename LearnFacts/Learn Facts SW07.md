## What have we learned?

### Review of the Posters

- Alignment of a textbox can improve a lot in visual clarity. Aligned to the left is the best for visual clarity
- For sectioning, a fine line is more minimalistic than a whole block. Therefore, the teacher liked our poster improvement
- Round shapes take a lot of space, but can also look very good

### Advantages of visual clarity

- Enhances usability
- Improves user satisfaction
- Reduces errors

### Using icon on the example of floppy disk

- Even though no one really uses a floppy disk today anymore, everyone knows the icon
- The floppy disk icon has exactely one meaning. When you press a floppy disk button, everyone knows that something will be saved
- The icon is different from other icons, there will be no misunderstanding
- A big advantages of the icon is, that the most people don’t like to read, so they prefer icons

### UX vs UI

- UX is more about the common ground what the user needs and not about personal oppinion or what is exstetic
- UX is more about the context of the user
- UI is more the actual implementation

## What was difficult?

The difference between UI and UX was not so easy to understand in the beginning, however after some research, a lot more was clear.

## What was the highlight?

The highlight was to improve the poster. At first, we didn’t think we can improve a lot because we liked what we already did. Nevertheless, we made one small change after another and in the end, everything worked out properly and we think in the end it looks pretty good. A lot small changes can lead to a big redesign in the end.

## What was the lowlight?

In the break, we had a little table soccer match and i lost. But in the lecture itself, there wasn’t a low light, everything was good and we could learn a lot.

## What advice can you give other students on this topic? By quote, by picture, by video?

Tipps to improve visual clarity

- Just little shades or hints or icons help makes everything more visible
- Scaling things bigger can also help
- A hierarchy like we learned in navigation can also improve a lot
- Putting the most important things in the front
- Put not every things on the same place, make it balanced
- Look out for the contrast
- Make everything consistent eg. use for the buttons the same shade or colours
- Make everything as simple as possible
