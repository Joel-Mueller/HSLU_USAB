## Artifacts that we have created and delivered

We watched a couple of videos and discussed them while looking at some examples.

## What have we learned?

UX Writing is the practice of crafting text that users interact with in digital interfaces. This includes microcopy like buttons, error messages, and onboarding instructions. The goal is to make these interactions:

1. **Clear and Understandable**: Every word should guide the user and eliminate ambiguity.
2. **Purpose-Driven**: Ensure the text aligns with the user's needs and the app‚Äôs functionality.
3. **User-Centric**: Adapt to the target audience's expectations and needs.

### Examples of Microcopy

- **Buttons**: Instead of generic labels like "Submit," use specific actions like "Add to Cart" or "Start Cooking."
- **Placeholders**: A search bar might display, "Search recipes by ingredient or name."
- **Error Messages**: Provide actionable advice: "Your password must include at least 8 characters and one symbol."
- **Encouraging Waiting Messages**: While loading, messages like "Fetching your next great recipe!" or "Almost there‚Äîhang tight!" reduce user frustration.

## Principles of UX Writing

1. **Active and Direct Language**
   - Use verbs and action-oriented language: "Save," "Explore," "Find Recipes."

2. **Adapt to Your Audience**
   - Match the tone to the user demographic. For young students like Annabella, casual and friendly language often works best.
   - For professional tools, use a more formal and concise tone.

3. **Maintain Context Awareness**
   - Users should feel understood. For instance, after a mistake, an error message like "We couldn‚Äôt process your payment. Please check your card details and try again" acknowledges the problem and guides the solution.

4. **Incorporate Friendly Guidance**
   - Example: When setting up a username, "Pick something unique! For example: @AnnabellaCooks."

5. **Leverage Numbers and Recognizable Icons**
   - Replace long dates with terms like "Today" or "Tomorrow" when possible.
   - Use universally understood symbols: a magnifying glass for search, a star for favorites.

## Dimensions of Tonality

Tonality is key in UX Writing. It defines how the app communicates based on the context. Consider these dimensions:

1. **Funny ‚Üî Serious**
   - Funny: "Oops! Looks like the cat walked on your keyboard."
   - Serious: "Unable to save. Check your connection and try again."

2. **Formal ‚Üî Casual**
   - Formal: "Your request has been processed successfully."
   - Casual: "Done and done!"

3. **Respectful ‚Üî Irreverent**
   - Respectful: "We noticed you haven‚Äôt saved your progress. Would you like to save now?"
   - Irreverent: "Hey, you forgot to hit save!"

4. **Enthusiastic ‚Üî Matter-of-Fact**
   - Enthusiastic: "Awesome! You‚Äôve unlocked a new feature!"
   - Matter-of-Fact: "Feature unlocked."
