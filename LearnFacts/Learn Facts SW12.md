## What have we learned?

For what is Usability testing good?
- Maybe the producer thinks it is common sense but for the end user it is not so clear
- When you want to see if a idea is actually good, you dont need a usable product you just need to see if its good

There are a lot of stages for testng
1. Designablity (Some people have the wrong product right because nowbody buys it) -> wen want to understand the user need, we call this also pretotyping
2. Test how it works, now it is prototyping, should be 10 Franks and the last one 100 Franks
3. Test how it feels, for example visual design should be 1000 Franks

How to test it
- Test only scenarios and those screens must be ready
- If you want to see if something works dont just figma that early, thest it first with other things because the ui is just distracting
- You can test with paper a lot before figma

- You should not test it because you are to close to the product
- Ask user to speak out loud
- Pick random peple (Better stranger because they are more honest than friends)
- Take notes what peple say
- After five people it is mostly repetition
- Do it again

Usabiltiy Walkthrough
- You need a test person
- You need a guide to talk to the person
- You need someone to take notes or a camera
- Maybe you need someone who changes the states
- You need a person which changes the stages

Test
- Have a scenario first
- A user shoudl talk a lot, if the person doen't talk a lot, you need to ask qeustion
- As a guide just say the state but not press here or somkething else what do do
